**Practice: SQL - 1 - SQL User Management Operations**
* In this assignment, I practiced creating data, editing data, and filtering data with sorting options. 

* The most difficult thing was understanding how to connect a repo to the sql file and save it correctly.

**Practice: SQL - 2 - Advanced SQL Queries - Joins, Subqueries, Grouping**
* I got a lot of clarification on the difference between table and column sub-queries, as well as why table sub-queries require an alias in order to function properly.
* That is also what was most challenging. The lesson covered the other material pretty well.
